# BLUF

Decisions, not essays. Your agent answers in its first line. When it needs you, it hands you the question, its recommendation, and the exact reply that approves it.

![BLUF demo: the same question to the same agent, without BLUF and with it](../../assets/bluf-demo.gif)

*Same agent (Pi), same question, nothing else loaded. The only difference is the BLUF rules.*

## What changes

- **The answer comes first.** The first line starts with `BLUF:` and says the answer, outcome, or verdict.
- **Asks become decisions.** Anything the agent needs from you goes under `Needs you:` as a numbered question with its recommendation and a `Reply:` you can send back as-is.
- **Sized to the stakes.** Routine choices get one line. Spending, sending, deleting, or anything you can't undo gets the full brief: options, cost, risk, what's kept or lost, deadline, evidence.
- **Checked versus guessed.** It says what it verified and marks what it's inferring.
- **Bad news first.** A failure or a mistake goes in the first line.

## Install

From the [skeleton-crew README](../../README.md#install). For Claude Code and Codex, the installer also adds a short block to your global instructions, because those agents don't apply a skill on every reply by themselves. Pi applies it from the skill alone.

## Does it work?

Measured with `evals/run.sh`; see [RESULTS.md](../../evals/RESULTS.md). With BLUF on, every answer from Claude Code, Codex and Pi opened with `BLUF:` (21 of 21; none with it off). Decision replies: Claude Code 3/3, Codex 2/3, Pi 3/3. Tested by hand on Mac, Linux and Windows 11, including the Claude Desktop Code tab.

## Turn it off

Run the uninstaller from the [skeleton-crew README](../../README.md#turn-it-off). It removes only the block it added.
